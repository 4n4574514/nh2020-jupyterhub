# Getting access

Access to the JupyterHub and associated storage is controlled by an Access
Control List (ACL). Please add yourself to the
[ACL](https://github.com/neurohackademy/nh2020-jupyterhub/edit/master/deployments/hub-neurohackademy-org/config/common.yaml)
by forking the GitHub repository and proposing a change to the file. In the
proposed change title (commit message) just write "acl: adding myself".
